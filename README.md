# NextGenInterns_DS_03
I made a data science project as an Intern in NextGenInterns. My task was of Data Science Taks03 i.e., Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will
purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral
data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI
Machine Learning Repository.
